1 - find node for division

2 - divide Node for Division (ND)


Dividing of ND:
    X in R(n, d)
    
    X = Transform(X)  #########   PCA, PCAcov, uniform  -> X in R(n,d) n = 5000, d = 35
        
    Choice of number of browsed variables (d1 <= d) -> X in R(n, d1) d1 = 10 (variable ranking, variable scoring, ...)

    for all combinations of few (2-3) variables from 15   X2
        X2 = Transform(X2)
        X2a, X2b = Cluster(X2) (k-means)
        count divergences

    find best division
    divide
